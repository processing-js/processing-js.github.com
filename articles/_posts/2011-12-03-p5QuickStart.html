        Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        This quick start guide is written from the standpoint of a Processing developer.
        No HTML or JavaScript knowledge is assumed, and only basic Processing knowledge
        is necessary.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Processing.js is written in JavaScript, and uses HTML5's &lt;canvas&gt; element.
            It converts your Processing code to JavaScript and runs it.</li>
        <li>To use it, download Processing.js here: <a href="http://processingjs.org/download">
            downloads</a></li>
        <li>Make your Processing *.pde files as you normally would, for example hello-web.pde</li>
        <li>Create a web page that includes Processing.js as well as a &lt;canvas&gt; with info
            about where to get your sketch file (you can specify multiple *.pde files, separating
            them with spaces):</li>
    </ol>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="processing-1.0.0.min.js"></script>
<canvas data-processing-sources="hello-web.pde"></canvas>
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Load your web page, and it will parse, translate, and run your sketch in the browser.</p>
    <h3 id="whyprocessingjs">Why Processing.js?</h3>
    <h4 id="javatojavascript"><b>The Web: from Java to JavaScript</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing is built using Java. It was created at much the same time that the web
        was starting. At this time the choice of the Java language, and Java Runtime, as
        implementation targets for Processing made a lot of sense. In the mid-1990s, Java
        was poised to become the language of the web, with Applets and other Java technologies
        being used broadly on the client-side. Even Netscape, who created the language which
        would eventually become the lingua franca of the web with JavaScript, named their
        language so as to align themselves with the growing hype around Java.</p>
    <p>
        In the end, Java became an important server side technology, receding from the client-side
        and browser. Today, most web browsers still support Java Applets, by means of a
        binary plugin. However, few web developers deploy Java-based web applications now,
        due to long load and startup times and difficulties relying on Java (or compatible
        Java versions) being installed. This trend is not isolated to Java, but is happening
        to all browser plugins (e.g., Flash), which are becoming less popular as issues
        of security, installation, deployment, etc. make them inconvenient or risky.</p>
    <p>
        Another reason that plugins like Java and Flash have fallen out of favour is that
        recent advances in standard web technologies, specifically HTML5 and JavaScript,
        have made it possible to do things that previously depended on native (i.e., faster,
        compiled) code. Companies like Google, with GMail and Google Docs, or Scribd (see
        <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30964170/Scribd-in-HTML5">Scribd-in-HTML5</a>)
        have shown that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alone are enough to build fast, full featured
        web applications.</p>
    <h4 id="modernwebstandards"><b>Processing.js uses Modern Web Standards</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing.js is built using JavaScript and HTML5. Processing.js is really two things:
        a Processing-to-JavaScript translator; and an implementation of the Processing API
        (e.g., functions like line(), stroke(), etc.) written in JavaScript instead of Java.
        It might seem odd at first to imagine your Processing sketches running in a browser,
        usually without modification. But this is exactly what Processing.js enables.</p>
    <p>
        Processing.js automatically converts your Processing code to JavaScript. This means
        that you don't have to learn JavaScript in order to run your code in a browser.
        You can, quite literally, write your code using the Processing IDE like you always
        have, and follow the steps below to get it running on the web. There's nothing new
        to learn, beyond getting a simple web page created.</p>
    <p>
        Under the hood, Processing.js uses the new HTML5 canvas element to create your sketch's
        graphics. The canvas element is a new feature of the web, and is either implemented
        or will be implemented by all major web browsers. All Processing drawing features
        have been reimplemented in Processing.js to use canvas, so any browser that supports
        canvas will also support Processing.js.</p>
    <p>
        Here's a sample of a Processing.js sketch running in the browser. If you can see
        it working, your browser supports everything you need already, and you can move
        on to instructions below.</p>
    <canvas data-src="/sketches/basic-example.pde"></canvas>
    <h3 id="writingsketches">Writing a Processing.js Sketch</h3>
    <p>
        There's nothing you should do differently to write sketches for Processing.js: you
        write your Processing.js code exactly like Processing. For most people, this will
        mean using the Processing IDE, which has the nice benefit of letting you write,
        run, and test your code all in once place. Remember, any valid Processing sketch
        should also be a valid Processing.js sketch.</p>
    <p>
        If you want to experiment with web-based Processing.js code editors, you can also
        try these:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://sketch.processing.org/">http://sketch.processing.org/</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://sketchpad.cc/">http://sketchpad.cc/</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://hascanvas.com/">http://hascanvas.com/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Let's make a simple sketch that is 200 by 200 in size, sets the background to gray,
        draws a small white circle, and prints a message to the debug console:</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(100);
  stroke(255);
  ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
  println("hello web!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        I'll assume below that you saved this to a file called hello-web.pde
    </p>
    <h3 id="obtainingpjs">Obtaining Processing.js</h3>
    <p>
        Processing.js is a JavaScript library that is meant to be included in a web page.
        You don't have to compile it, tell your web server about it, etc. It simply has
        to be included in a web page, and the browser will do the rest.</p>
    <p>
        You can download Processing.js at <a href="http://processingjs.org/download">the download
            page</a>. The library comes in a number of forms, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>processing-1.0.0.js (note that 1.0.0 is just the version, the number might be higher
            when you look at this)</li>
        <li>processing-1.0.0.min.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The version numbers may be different as you read this, but note the file extensions.
        Both end in .js, but one also has .min. The .min version is Processing.js in a minified
        form, which means it will be smaller to download (minified JavaScript uses tricks
        like removing whitespace and renaming long variable names to single letters). File
        sizes, and download times, matter on the web in a way they don't with normal Processing
        sketches.</p>
    <h3 id="creatingpjswebpage">Creating a Processing.js Web Page</h3>
    <p>
        It's easy to get overwhelmed with the amount there is to learn about modern web
        technologies. But there's a secret: you can ignore 95% of it as you start, and add
        more later as you have time and interest. Unlike compilers or programming languages,
        web browsers are designed to accept almost any input you throw at them, whether
        valid or not, whether complete or not. Here's your first Processing.js web page:</p>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="processing-1.0.0.min.js"></script>
<canvas data-processing-sources="hello-web.pde"></canvas>
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        That's it! No &lt;html&gt; or &lt;body&gt; tags, no title, no CSS, just the processing.js
        script, and a canvas. While there isn't much here, it's important to understand
        what is. First, the script tag has a <b>src</b> attribute, which is the file to
        load. This could be a full url or a relative path. In this case the browser is going
        to look for a file named <b>processing-1.0.0.min.js</b> in the same directory as
        your web page.</p>
    <p>
        The second thing in this web page is a &lt;canvas&gt tag. Notice that it too has
        an attribute, <b>data-processing-sources</b>. This is a list of filenames (or just
        one filename if you only have 1 file) separated by spaces (filenames and URLs on
        the web can't include spaces, so space is a safe choice for separating lists). In
        this case, the browser is going to look for a file named <b>hello-web.pde</b> located
        in the same directory as your page page.</p>
    <p>
        How does the browser know how to load a Processing *.pde file? Processing.js takes
        care of this, and will download, parse (i.e., translate to JavaScript), then run
        it automatically when the page is loaded.</p>
    <p>
        And that's it! Save this file to the same directory as <b>hello-web.pde</b> and
        <b>processing-1.0.0.min.js</b> and call it <b>hello-web.html</b>.</p>
    <p>
        If you're the kind of person who doesn't like taking shortcuts, here's what a more
        complete web page might look like:</p>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello Web - Processing.js Test</title>
    <script src="processing-1.0.0.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Processing.js Test</h1>
    <p>This is my first Processing.js web-based sketch:</p>
    <canvas data-processing-sources="hello-web.pde"></canvas>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Both ways work, and you shouldn't let yourself get burdened by HTML and other web
        syntax until you feel you want to do other things with your web pages.</p>
    <h3 id="runningpjswebpage">Running your Processing.js Web Page</h3>
    <p>
        In case it isn't obvious, you run your <b>hello-web.pde</b> sketch by loading your
        <b>hello-web.html</b> web page in a compatible browser. Web browsers will provide
        you a way to load a local file, usually using the File menu and then <i>Open File....</i>
        If you've saved the files above on a web server, you can use the remote URL instead.</p>
    <h3 id="thingstoknowusingpjs">Things to Know as a Processing Developer using Processing.js</h3>
    <p>
        While Processing.js is compatible with Processing, Java is not JavaScript, and canvas
        has some differences from Java's graphics classes. Here are some tricks and tips
        as you start working on more complex sketches in Processing.js.</p>
    <h4 id="nodatadirectory"><b>Processing.js has no data directory</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing uses the concept of a <b>data</b> directory, where images and other resources
        are located. Processing.js does not include this. As a result, you should always
        provide file pages (e.g., images) that are relative to your web page, which is the
        norm on the web.</p>
    <h4 id="implementationofjava"><b>Processing.js implements Processing, but not all of Java</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing.js is compatible with Processing, but is not, and will never be, fully
        compatible with Java. If your sketch uses functions or classes not defined as part
        of Processing, they are unlikely to work with Processing.js. Similarly, libraries
        that are written for Processing, which are written in Java instead of Processing,
        will most likely not work.</p>
    <h4 id="renderingmodes"><b>Processing.js only has two rendering modes</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing has many rendering modes to choose from, depending on the desired quality
        and speed for graphics (e.g., OPENGL, P3D, JAVA2D, etc.). Processing.js uses &lt;canvas&gt;
        which provides either a 2D drawing context or a 3D context based on WebGL (a version
        of OpenGL for the web). Therefore, whatever you choose, you will end-up with either
        the 2D or 3D context.</p>
    <h4 id="explicitcasting"><b>Division which is expected to produce an integer might need explicit casting</b></h4>
    <p>
        There are a class of bugs that arise when converting Processing code to Processing.js
        that involve integer vs. floating point division. What was straight-up integer division
        in Processing code, when converted to Processing.js, can sometimes become problematic,
        as numbers become doubles, and introduce a fractional part. The fix is to explicitly
        cast any division to an integer that exhibits this behaviour:</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
// before
int g = mouseX / i;

// after
int g = (int)(mouseX / i);
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        See <a href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284/tickets/532-drawing-artifacts-in-processingjs-not-in-processing-with-this-code">
            lighthouse bug</a></p>
    <h4 id="synchronousIO"><b>Processing.js has to cheat to simulate Processing's synchronous I/O</b></h4>
    <p>
        Processing uses a synchronous I/O model, which means that functions like <b>loadImage()</b>
        take time to execute, and while they are running, nothing else happens: the program
        waits until <b>loadImage()</b> is done before moving on to the next statement. This
        means that you can count on the value returned by a function like <b>loadImage()</b>
        being usable in the next line of code.</p>
    <p>
        Web browsers don't work like this. The web uses an asynchronous I/O model, which
        means that functions which load external resources can't make the program wait until
        they finish. In order to replicate Processing's load* functions, you have to use
        a special Processing.js Directive.</p>
    <p>
        The Processing.js Directives are hints to the browser that are written in comments
        rather than in the Processing code itself. Here's a typical Processing sketch that
        loads an image synchronously and then draws it:</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
PImage img;

void setup() {
  img = loadImage("picture.jpg");
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        This code will not work in the browser with Processing.js, because the call to <b>image()</b>
        will happen before the file <b>picture.jpg</b> has been downloaded. The fix is to
        ask Processing.js to download the image before the sketch starts, and cache it--a
        technique known as preloading. Here is the modified code:</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
/* @pjs preload="picture.jpg"; */
PImage img;

void setup() {
  img = loadImage("picture.jpg");
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Notice the extra comment line at the top of the code. The <b>@pjs</b> directive
        is for Processing.js, and not the developer. Think of it as an extra line of code
        that will be executed before the program begins.</p>
    <p>
        If you have multiple images to load, use a list like so:</p>

{% highlight java linenos%}
/* @pjs preload="picture.jpg,picture2.jpg,picture3.png"; */
{% endhighlight %}

    <h4 id="variablenamingcare"><b>Processing.js requires more care with variable naming than Processing</b></h4>
    <p>
        One of the powerful features of JavaScript is its dynamic, typeless nature. Where
        typed languages like Java, and therefore Processing, can reuse names without fear
        of ambiguity (e.g., method overloading), Processing.js cannot. Without getting into
        the inner-workings of JavaScript, the best advice for Processing developers is to
        not use function/class/etc. names from Processing as variable names. For example,
        a variable named <b>line</b> might seem reasonable, but it will cause issues with
        the similarly named <b>line()</b> function built-into Processing and Processing.js.
        This is equally true for built-in functions and functions you create. A good rule-
        of-thumb is: avoid having a variable <b>foo</b> in the same sketch as a function 
        <b>foo();</b>.</p>

    <h4 id="methodoverriding"><b>Processing.js needs your help when overriding overloaded superclass methods</b></h4>
    <p>
        If your code uses subclasses that override one or more overloaded methods in the superclass, you
        will need "dummy" overrides for every method signature that you'd normally leave untouched:</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
class X
{
  void doSomething()
  {
    ...
  }
  
  void doSomething(float x, float y)
  {
    ...
  }
}

class Y extends X
{
  void doSomething()
  {
    // different code from compared to the super class
  }
  
  // even though we don't override this method,
  // its signature must be added to prevent Pjs
  // from getting the method chain wrong:
  void doSomething(float x, float y)
  {
    super.doSomething(x,y);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Even though in Processing you will not need to implement the fallthrough method for doSomethign with a
        (float,float) signature, doing so is almost always necessary to make sure Processing.js doesn't get
        confused about which class's method to call.</p>

    <h4 id="colorrange"><b>Calling color() with out-of-range values produces unpredictable colors</b></h4>
    <p>
        Also in the class of integer vs. floating point issues, color(number) and color(number, number)
        may not behave quite as expected. In native Processing, color(int) and color(float) behave
        differently in that the first is used for full color integers. Calling color(#FF0000) and
        color(16711680) are the same call, so they produce a red color. However, when using float
        values the color()/1 function treats the input as gray values, between 0 and the max indicated
        value (255, by default). Any value lower than 0 or higher than max is simply capped. Because of
        the integer vs. floating point issues with JavaScript, Processing.js does not perform any capping,
        and so even though the following code will show a black and a white line in Processing, it will
        show a yellow line, and an "invisible" line in Processing.js instead.</p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
void setup()
{
  size(100,100);
  noLoop();
}

void draw()
{
  background(127);
  stroke(-200.0);
  line(0,25,width,25);
  stroke(600.0);
  line(0,75,width,75);
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>We recommend you always sanitize your inputs for color if you need colors to be "in range", and only use hex colors, using color(#RRGGBB), or rgb/rgba colors, using color(r,g,b) and color(r,g,b,a)</p>
    <h3 id="processingcodeinwebpage"><b>It is possible to put Processing code directly in your web page</b></h3>
    <p>
        Using the data-processing-sources attribute on the canvas, and having Processing.js
        load an external file is the preferred and recommended way to include scripts in
        a web page. However, it is also possible to write in-line Processing code.</p>
    <p>
        A few changes are necessary to make the example above work with inline Processing
        code:</p>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="processing-1.3.6.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/processing" data-processing-target="processing-canvas">
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(100);
  stroke(255);
  ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
  println('hello web!');
}
</script>
<canvas id="processing-canvas"> </canvas>
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        This code is more complex because it has to figure out which canvas goes with which
        script (i.e., you can have multiple Processing sketches living in the same page,
        and therefore, multiple canvases). Also note that the scripts include a <b>type</b>
        attribute, which distinguishes between JavaScript and Processing code (the browser
        will ignore Processing scripts). Finally, note the use of the <b>id</b> and <b>target</b>
        attributes to connect the Processing script with the associated canvas.</p>
    <h3 id="whateveryoucandowiththeweb"><b>Whatever you can do with the web, you can do with Processing.js</b></h3>
    <p>
        Now that your sketch is working, and you have a basic web page, you'll probably
        start getting ideas about how to make this look more beautiful, how to better integrate
        your sketch with the surrounding web page or site, and how to mix data from various
        web services and APIs. Is it possible to mix images on Flickr and a Processing.js
        sketch? Yes. Is it possible to link Twitter to Processing.js? Yes. Anything the
        web can do, your Processing.js sketch can do.</p>
    <p>
        This is an important idea, and is worth restating: Processing.js turned your once
        Java-based code into JavaScript, and your graphics into &lt;canvas&gt;. As a result,
        anything you read on the web about dynamic web programming, AJAX, other JavaScript
        libraries or APIs, all of it applies to your sketch now. You aren't running code
        in a box, cut-off from the rest of the web. Your code is a first-class member of
        the web, even though you didn't write it that way.</p>
    <p>
        If you're feeling adventurous and want to go learn more about how to do other thing
        with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. remember that everything they say applies to you
        and your sketches.</p>
